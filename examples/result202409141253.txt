## SUMMARY
1Password discusses the controversial "SSO tax," where software vendors charge significantly for Single Sign-On, likening it to charging extra for essential safety features.

## IDEAS:
- The SSO tax is an unofficial term for significant upcharges for Single Sign-On services.
- Critics compare charging for SSO to charging extra for seatbelts in cars.
- Vendors argue SSO is a luxury feature akin to a sunroof.
- SSO is increasingly seen as a security necessity rather than a luxury.
- Companies prefer SSO to reduce the number of weak access points.
- SSO simplifies employee onboarding and offboarding processes.
- The rise in ransomware attacks has made SSO more urgent for companies.
- Many applications remain outside of companies' SSO portals due to high costs.
- Vendors justify the SSO tax by citing high building and maintenance costs.
- Some vendors admit that SSO pricing is primarily about profit.
- The SSO tax can be a powerful upselling tool for vendors.
- Not charging for SSO can enhance a vendor's reputation and customer loyalty.
- Industry security could improve if SSO were not treated as a luxury feature.
- Product-led growth strategies may be hindered by the SSO tax.
- Companies can negotiate for SSO during the purchase process.
- Using an enterprise password manager can help secure logins without SSO.

## QUOTES:
- "Charging for SSO is like buying a car and having to pay extra for the seatbelts."
- "In reality, SSO is probably most analogous to a rearview camera."
- "SSO creates one strong access point rather than many weak ones."
- "The stunning increase in ransomware attacks... has changed SSO from a luxury to a necessity."
- "If you’re a new SaaS founder and you want to maximize your revenue, I recommend you create an enterprise tier, put SSO in it, and charge 2-5x your normal pricing."
- "Having shipped SSO, I have no qualms about considering it a service that needs to be paid for."
- "With single sign-on, we’re protecting both of our companies."
- "The enormous markups I see for these vendors cannot be feasibly attributed to the SSO cost."
- "SSO is a segmentation lever, and a particularly powerful one."
- "The SSO tax isn’t going anywhere (unless we make it)."
  
## FACTS:
- 80% of SaaS applications used by employees are not in their companies' SSO portals.
- Some vendors charge over 5,000% more for SSO compared to their base pricing.
- Ransomware attacks have increased significantly in recent years.
- Many companies struggle to maintain SSO functionality across multiple applications due to costs.
- The practice of charging for essential security features is often criticized as unfair.
