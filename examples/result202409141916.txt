## SUMMARY
Carl Tashian discusses securing homelab access using YubiKey and mutual TLS, detailing a workflow that enhances security and usability.

## IDEAS:
- YubiKeys provide more than U2F authentication; they can secure access to homelabs.
- Mutual TLS involves both client and server authenticating each other, reducing attack surfaces.
- Hardware-bound keys on YubiKeys enhance security by preventing key export.
- The ACME protocol can be privately hosted for internal use in homelabs.
- Device attestation allows trusted devices to prove their identity to a CA.
- The YubiKey's PIV application enables smart card capabilities for secure key management.
- Attestation certificates verify the residency and security policy of private keys.
- Caddy can manage TLS certificates and act as a reverse proxy for homelab resources.
- Using mutual TLS can be more secure than traditional web applications.
- The tutorial provides a step-by-step guide for setting up a secure homelab environment.
- Dynamic DNS may be necessary for accessing homelabs with changing IP addresses.
- The YubiKey can generate non-exportable private keys, enhancing security.
- The tutorial includes methods for self-hosting a Certificate Authority (CA).
- Caddy's configuration requires careful ordering of root and intermediate CA certificates.
- The author emphasizes the importance of testing configurations across different browsers.
- The setup allows remote access to homelab resources securely.

## QUOTES:
- "Mutual TLS is two-way TLS authentication: the client and server both have TLS certificates."
- "Client certificates become even more secure when the associated private key is generated and stored in a hardware device."
- "YubiKeys can prove to any third party that its private keys are hardware-bound."
- "The more involved but also very fun and more secure way to self-host a CA is to follow my blog post."
- "Caddy will get and manage a Let’s Encrypt certificate for my homelab hostname."
- "The root CA does not need to be in macOS trust store for client authentication; only for server authentication."
- "If you want to expose anything from your homelab on the public internet, a server protected with mutual TLS is a pretty good bet."
- "The tutorial provides a step-by-step guide for setting up a secure homelab environment."
- "You’ll need to add both your root and intermediate CA certificates to Caddy’s configuration."
- "The YubiKey will only attest a private key that's been generated directly on the YubiKey."

## FACTS:
- Mutual TLS is popular with governments and militaries due to its security features.
- The ACME protocol was extended in 2022 with a device attestation challenge type.
- YubiKeys can generate several hardware-bound private keys via PIV.
- The default validity period for certificates issued by `step-ca` is 24 hours.
- Caddy can manage Let's Encrypt certificates without needing to add the root CA to clients' trust stores.
- Dynamic DNS services can help maintain access to homelabs with changing IP addresses.
- The YubiKey's firmware version can be inspected through its attestation certificate.
- The tutorial mentions using Raspberry Pi for self-hosting a CA, enhancing accessibility.
- The YubiKey's internal CA signs attestation certificates, ensuring their authenticity.
- The tutorial includes links to additional resources for further learning.

## RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use YubiKeys for enhanced security in accessing homelabs remotely.
- Implement mutual TLS for secure client-server authentication in web applications.
- Consider self-hosting a Certificate Authority for internal certificate management.
- Regularly test configurations across different browsers to ensure compatibility.
- Utilize Dynamic DNS services if your homelab has a changing IP address.
- Explore using Caddy as a reverse proxy for managing access to homelab resources.
- Generate hardware-bound keys on YubiKeys to prevent unauthorized access.
- Follow best practices for configuring CA policies to restrict certificate issuance.
- Use attestation certificates to verify the integrity of private keys stored on YubiKeys.
- Keep your YubiKey firmware updated for optimal performance and security.
