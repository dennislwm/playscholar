## SUMMARY
The GitHub ADR organization promotes Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) to document significant design choices in software and hardware systems.

## IDEAS:
- Architectural Decisions (ADs) are crucial for addressing significant functional or non-functional requirements.
- Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) serve as a decision log for projects.
- ADRs can extend beyond architecture to include any significant decision.
- Capturing architectural decisions enhances agile practices and iterative engineering processes.
- Lightweight ADRs consist of title, status, context, decision, and consequences.
- Understanding pros and cons of options is essential for making informed decisions.
- The Y-statement format helps articulate the rationale behind architectural decisions.
- A Definition of Done for ADRs includes criteria like evidence and documentation.
- Various templates exist for documenting ADRs, including MADR and others.
- Good practices and anti-patterns in ADR creation can improve decision-making processes.
- Tools like adr-tools and adr-manager facilitate the management of ADRs.
- Architectural decision capturing is recognized as an essential activity in design practices.
- The concept of Architectural Knowledge Management (AKM) supports effective decision documentation.
- ADRs can streamline technical decision-making in software development projects.
- The relationship between ADRs and other decision-making frameworks is significant.
- Public knowledge resources enhance understanding and implementation of ADRs.
