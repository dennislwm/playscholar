### SUMMARY
The article by MQL5 discusses developing a risk manager class for algorithmic trading to improve risk control and trading outcomes in financial markets.

### IDEAS:
- Risk management is crucial in algorithmic trading to enhance profitability and minimize drawdowns.
- The article aims to adapt risk control principles for algorithmic trading through a dedicated class.
- It emphasizes using inheritance in MQL5 to build upon existing functionalities without duplicating code.
- Definitions of key trading concepts like Stop Loss, Take Profit, and Slippage are provided for clarity.
- Implementing a slippage control mechanism helps monitor the actual risk when opening positions.
- The risk manager class is designed to be flexible for integration with various trading strategies.
- The article illustrates the importance of spreading control before opening positions to ensure favorable trading conditions.
- A systematic approach to risk management can transform losing strategies into profitable ones.
- The article utilizes practical examples of coding a risk manager in MQL5.
- Optimizing parameters based on historical data can lead to improved trading outcomes.
- The presence of market momentum is essential for successful trading at fractal levels.
- Risks should always be assessed against expected returns to maintain a balanced trading strategy.
- The risk manager aims to standardize risk relative to market momentum for better performance.
- Testing different configurations can reveal optimal risk-to-reward ratios.
- The article concludes that systematic risk management is vital for long-term trading success.
- Continuous feedback and adjustment of risk parameters can enhance trading effectiveness.

### QUOTES:
- "The purpose of this article is to adapt the principles of controlled risk to algorithmic trading."
- "Risk control can significantly improve the trading results of even a profitable strategy."
- "We will develop a risk manager class to control risks in algorithmic trading."
- "By using inheritance, we can save development time and ensure easier work with our architecture."
- "If the price goes in the direction opposite to the position we have opened, we limit losses."
- "The sum of all risks for all entries should not exceed the risk for the day."
- "The main task of this code is to close all open positions at 23:00."
- "Even with a profitable strategy, the key to efficient operation in the financial markets is compliance with risk management."
- "A losing strategy can be turned into a profitable one if proper risk management is applied."
- "You can always control the standardized risks with the help of a risk manager."
- "The graph of the optimization results shows that most of the results are in the zone of positive mathematical expectation."
- "If the current spread size exceeds the user-acceptable range, the method should return false."
- "This means that if the spread is half the stop, you either need to wait for a smaller spread or refuse to enter."
- "The use of a risk manager is mandatory to control risks."
- "It is imperative to select logically justified risks relative to the capabilities of your trading strategy."
- "I strongly recommend not to trade on real accounts with the risk manager disabled."

### FACTS:
- Intraday trading involves executing trades within a single day without holding positions overnight.
- Slippage occurs when an order is executed at a different price than requested due to market volatility.
- The risk manager class can control various risk parameters such as slippage and spread.
- The MQL5 programming language allows for advanced object-oriented programming techniques.
- The effectiveness of the risk manager was tested using the USDJPY pair over a year.
- Optimizing risk parameters can help in achieving a better risk-to-reward ratio.
- Daily fractal breaks can provide significant momentum for trading strategies.
- The concept of a calculated stop loss is based on the volatility of the asset.
- The risk manager's purpose includes minimizing losses during high market volatility.
- The article stresses the importance of technical stop loss based on analysis.
- The article discusses the implications of risk management on the overall trading strategy.
- The effectiveness of trading strategies can be analyzed through optimization results.
- Successful trading requires continuous monitoring and adjustment of risk parameters.
- The risk manager can help in executing trades safely while adhering to risk standards.
- The implementation of risk management principles can lead to more stable trading results.
- Proper risk management can protect traders from unexpected market movements.

- Apply principles of risk management consistently to avoid turning profitable strategies into losing ones.
- Consider using fractal levels as indicators for potential market momentum.
- Keep refining risk management practices based on ongoing trading results and market conditions.
- Always evaluate risks against expected returns to maintain a balanced trading strategy.
- Avoid trading with high risks relative to potential returns to prevent significant drawdowns.
- Encourage feedback and community discussions on risk management techniques in trading.
- Use technical analysis to inform stop loss placements and trading decisions.
