## SUMMARY
The article by Gamuchirai Zororo Ndawana explores the use of alternative data from FRED to predict EURUSD exchange rates but finds limited success.

## IDEAS:
- Modern investors struggle with selecting beneficial alternative datasets due to resource constraints.
- Correlation is vital for portfolio diversification and exposure management.
- The Nominal Broad Dollar Daily Index (NBDD) has shown significant fluctuations since its inception in 2006.
- A negative correlation between the Broad Dollar Index and EURUSD exchange rates was observed.
- Merging traditional market data with alternative datasets can improve predictive modeling.
- The study employed AI models to analyze relationships between datasets but faced challenges in prediction accuracy.
- Advanced data visualization techniques helped identify trends and correlations in the datasets.
- Despite strong initial correlations, the inclusion of alternative data did not enhance predictive performance.
- Feature selection algorithms showed that traditional market data explained target variance better than alternative datasets.
- The study utilized deep neural networks (DNN) but struggled with overfitting and residual misbehavior.
- Parameter tuning and optimization were conducted to enhance model performance.
- Residual analysis revealed issues with model predictions, suggesting further transformations may be needed.
- The exploration of additional models like Support Vector Machines could yield better results.
- Future research could investigate other alternative datasets for improved forecasting.
- The article emphasizes the complexity of integrating alternative data into trading strategies.
- An ONNX model was created to deploy the trained DNN for practical use.

## QUOTES:
- "Correlation is a cornerstone principle of an analytical approach to finance."
- "The index has been in a bullish trend since late 2011 and is currently hovering around 121 points."
- "When we perform this step, we can clearly observe that the index displays almost perfect negative correlation to the EURUSD Foreign Exchange rate."
- "Unfortunately, the residuals we observed from our model were badly misbehaved, which may suggest that our model has failed to learn effectively."
- "None of the FRED time-series were selected by the algorithm."
- "Our ordinary market data from MetaTrader 5 may be our best bet."
- "The squashed shape of the MetaTrader 5 error box-plot is desirable because it shows that the model is demonstrating skill through its consistent performance."
- "We cannot blindly trust our model and deploy it into production."
- "The red dot represents the optimal input values estimated by our TNC optimizer."
- "We failed to gain an edge over the rest of the market today."

## FACTS:
- The NBDD was established in January 2006, with an all-time low of approximately 86 points during the 2008 recession.
- The index set its all-time high of roughly 128 points in 2022.
- A correlation level of -0.9 was observed between the EURUSD exchange rate and the Broad Dollar Index.
- The article utilized three macroeconomic datasets from the FRED Python API: interest rates, expected inflation rates, and the Broad Dollar Index.
- The study employed deep neural networks (DNN) for predictive modeling.
- Feature importance analysis indicated that MetaTrader 5 market data alone explained the target variance well.
- Parameter tuning was performed using RandomizedSearchCV to improve model performance.
- The ONNX model format allows integration into various programming languages for deployment.
- The article suggests that there are countless alternative datasets available yet to be explored.
- The article concludes that the NBDD may not significantly aid in forecasting the EURUSD exchange rate.
