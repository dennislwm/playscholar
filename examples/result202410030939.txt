# SUMMARY
Richard McClintock discusses the stagnant state of mock data generation and how Neurelo aims to revolutionize it with high-fidelity, schema-based solutions.

# IDEAS:
- Mock data generation is essential for testing and development but has not significantly advanced.
- High-fidelity mock data can enhance software development lifecycles.
- Neurelo's goal is to simplify database interactions for users with empty data sources.
- The technology should be diverse, cost-effective, fast, and use native Rust.
- LLMs can generate code but struggle with consistent accuracy in mock data generation.
- Topological sorting is key for maintaining insertion order in databases.
- Handling cyclic relationships in schemas poses challenges for data generation.
- The integration of table names is crucial for accurate data classification.
- The Genesis Point Strategy can efficiently create unique mock data sets.
- Neurelo employs a JSON-schema spec to represent database schemas for mock data generation.

# QUOTES:
- "High-fidelity mock data that just works!"
- "We must not put the cart before the horse."
- "The order of insertion matters."
- "Dealing with anything closely tied to timestamps is a direct line to a mental institution."
- "Mock data generation is essential for testing and development but has not significantly advanced."
- "The quality of mock data is directly proportional to the classification pipeline of our LLM model."
- "If cyclic relationships are essential, one way to handle them is by breaking cycles using NULL values."
- "Inserting NULL values should not trigger incorrect behavior in such scenarios."
- "We encountered an interesting issue when mocking large amounts of data for a specific foreign key with a unique constraint."
- "The revolution in mock data generation is underway, and we are thrilled to be leading the charge."

# FACTS:
- Lorem ipsum text originated from Cicero's works and has been used since the 1500s.
- The Year 2038 problem affects systems running 32-bit MySQL versions before 5.6.4.
- A directed acyclic graph (DAG) is necessary for topological sorting in database schemas.
- Kahn's algorithm is a method for performing topological sorting.
- The faker module in Python aids in generating realistic mock data.
- Neurelo supports MongoDB, MySQL, and Postgres data sources.
- Unique constraints can complicate mock data generation if duplicates occur.
- The Genesis Point Strategy uses cross products to generate unique data efficiently.
- Neurelo's mock data generation technology is built entirely in Rust.
- The integration of cost-driven LLM strategies is a future goal for Neurelo.

- Leverage JSON-schema for clear representation of database structures.
- Optimize for unique constraints in mock data generation processes.
- Maintain a balance between cost and data generation accuracy in future projects.
- Utilize dictionaries to track mock data relationships for foreign and primary keys.
- Implement a robust testing framework for mock data to ensure quality and reliability.
