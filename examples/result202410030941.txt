### SUMMARY
Jacob Kaplan-Moss discusses the ethical applications of AI in the public sector, emphasizing the need for assistive AI over automated systems to prevent bias and ensure fairness.

### IDEAS:
- Massive advancements in AI technology are reshaping possibilities in software.
- There is a distinction between ethical and unethical applications of AI in public sectors.
- The term “AI” encompasses various technologies, leading to misunderstandings.
- Categories of AI include perception, automated judgment, predicting social outcomes, and generative algorithms.
- Predicting social outcomes with AI is largely seen as unethical and often inaccurate.
- Assistive AI processes information for human operators, enhancing decision-making.
- Automated AI operates independently, which raises ethical concerns, especially in the public sector.
- AI algorithms can perpetuate human biases, making their use in the public sector problematic.
- The expectation of fairness in public interactions with government necessitates careful AI deployment.
- Generative AI applications can be ethical when used assistively, not autonomously.
- The framework of assistive versus automated AI can apply to various fields beyond the public sector.
- There’s a need for nuanced discussions about the ethical implications of AI technologies.
- Ethical considerations in AI deployment are crucial for maintaining public trust.
- The hype around AI can cloud judgment about its real capabilities and applications.
- The author’s perspective evolved from experiences and observations made in 2021.
- Ethical frameworks should be adaptable to the rapid changes in AI technology.
- Transparency in AI applications is vital to combat misleading claims.

### QUOTES:
- "There’s some nuance here that I think is sometimes missing from modern discussions of AI."
- "Nearly everyone claiming to be able to do this is lying: their algorithms do not, in fact, make predictions that are any better than guesswork."
- "Organizations acting in the public good should avoid this area like the plague."
- "AI algorithms encode human bias."
- "Failure carries real life or death consequences."
- "When citizens interact with their governments, they have an expectation of fairness."
- "A self-driving car isn’t inherently 'good' or 'bad'; that’s determined by how much safer it is."
- "I wouldn’t dream of publishing a post written entirely by an algorithm."
- "The framework is somewhat limited; it’s not right to say that one category is always 'better' than another."
- "I believe that there are clear 'right' and 'wrong' ways to apply AI to public sector problems."

### FACTS:
- There have been significant developments in AI in the last decade.
- AI technologies can be categorized into perception, automated judgment, predicting social outcomes, and generative algorithms.
- Predictive policing is an example of an unethical application of AI.
- Algorithms used for social predictions can be deeply flawed and biased.
- The concept of assistive versus automated AI helps clarify ethical applications.
- Self-driving cars are still considered partially snake oil.
- Ethical implications of AI can extend beyond public sector applications.
- Advances in AI tools have changed perspectives on their potential uses.
- The hype surrounding AI can lead to misunderstandings about its capabilities.
- Public-sector failures due to AI can result in significant harm to individuals.

### RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Prioritize assistive AI tools in public sector applications to enhance human decision-making.
- Maintain transparency about AI capabilities to combat misinformation.
- Avoid reliance on predictive algorithms that claim to forecast social behavior.
- Foster discussions around the ethical implications of AI technologies.
- Consider the potential biases in algorithms before implementing them in public services.
- Encourage ongoing evaluation of AI applications to adapt to technological advancements.
- Promote public understanding of AI to align expectations with reality.
- Recognize that ethical frameworks may need to evolve alongside AI advancements.
- Engage with stakeholders to discuss the implications of AI in governance.
- Remain skeptical of overly optimistic claims regarding AI capabilities.
