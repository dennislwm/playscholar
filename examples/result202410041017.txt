## SUMMARY
Stefano Marinelli discusses his journey of migrating servers from Linux to BSDs, emphasizing problem-solving and the advantages of using Open Source solutions.

## IDEAS:
- Marinelli's passion for technology fuels his profession and problem-solving approach.
- He initially used Linux for secondary tasks while Windows was his main OS.
- His university experience helped him grasp Open Source concepts early on.
- Marinelli's work philosophy focuses on solving specific client problems rather than selling predefined solutions.
- He faced skepticism about BSD systems, which were often viewed as "toys for universities."
- Open Source solutions offered significant cost savings for clients.
- Marinelli has shifted towards BSDs for stability, security, and manageability.
- He emphasizes the importance of not creating new problems while solving existing ones.
- Docker and Podman are useful but not always the best choice for development environments.
- Marinelli's experience with data loss on Linux drives his preference for BSD systems.
- He successfully transitioned several clients' workloads to FreeBSD, achieving notable performance improvements.
- Many developers he works with have embraced BSDs and their benefits.
- The migration to BSDs allows for easier management and fewer surprises during updates.
- Marinelli advocates for simpler, more maintainable solutions over complex setups.
- His transition strategy involves migrating workloads that need updates or are problematic.
- He acknowledges the commercial challenges of promoting BSD solutions over popular Linux offerings.
- Marinelli enjoys positive feedback from clients about the reliability of BSD systems.

## QUOTES:
- “I solve problems.”
- “I would work for myself, following my own philosophy.”
- “In every technological decision, my priority is solving my clients’ specific problems.”
- “If nothing is working, what am I paying you for? If everything’s working, what am I paying you for?”
- “There isn’t a single solution to all problems, but many solutions for each problem.”
- “No *BSD has ever caused me to lose data to the point of having to restore from backup.”
- “Computing should solve problems and provide opportunities to those who use it.”
- “The simplest solutions are the easiest to maintain and manage over time.”
- “I solve problems. And these fast-changing technologies risk creating more problems than they solve.”
- “I’ve never encountered, for example, a network interface renaming... effectively locking me out of a server.”
- “My experience has taught me that setting something up is often the easiest part.”
- “Some VMs remained as VMs... By the end of the operation, I had drastically reduced the number of VMs.”
- “Many appreciate moving away from IT monocultures, especially when problems arise.”
- “I’m Stefano Marinelli, I solve problems. And I love solving problems using BSD systems.”

## FACTS:
- Marinelli has been a Linux user since 1996.
- He became one of the few students familiar with Open Source during his university years.
- His final thesis focused on virtualization on Open Source systems.
- He has transitioned 78% of hypervisors he manages to FreeBSD.
- 66% of workloads he manages run on one of the BSDs.
- OpenBSD was developed with security mechanisms dating back to 2001.
- Marinelli has successfully migrated workloads from Linux to BSDs for better performance and stability.
- He has faced ideological challenges when proposing BSD solutions.
- Marinelli has been using Docker and Podman since 2018 for specific developer needs.
- He highlights that many developers have shifted their preferences towards BSD jails over Docker.
- His clients have reported a significant performance boost after migrating to FreeBSD.
- No BSD system has ever surprised him during an update or reboot.
- He promotes the idea that every additional layer of complexity in IT creates more problems.

## RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Emphasize problem-solving over selling predefined solutions.
- Explore BSD systems for their reliability and security benefits.
- Use Open Source solutions to reduce costs and improve efficiency.
- Prioritize the stability and maintainability of IT solutions.
- Educate clients on the advantages of BSD systems versus popular solutions.
- Consider migrating to BSD systems for workloads that require stability and longevity.
- Implement simpler solutions to avoid unnecessary complexity in IT management.
- Encourage developers to learn and experiment with new operating methods.
- Foster a culture of understanding and managing technology rather than just using it.
- Address commercial appeal when proposing alternative solutions to decision-makers.
- Regularly assess and reflect on the effectiveness of current IT solutions.
- Be open to feedback and adapt strategies based on client experiences.
