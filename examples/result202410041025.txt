# SUMMARY
Hikari no Yume expresses frustration about the detrimental effects of Twitter's algorithm on nuanced conversations and community engagement in their blog post.

# IDEAS:
- Complaining about algorithms on social media has become cliché, yet is a serious issue.
- Twitter's character limit restricts nuanced discussions, making complex ideas hard to convey.
- Threads allow for more context but can lead to audience escape and misinterpretation.
- Audience escape occurs when tweets reach unintended audiences, often leading to misunderstandings.
- The algorithm has changed to prioritize engagement and topics, losing the personal connections that defined Twitter.
- The algorithmic timeline creates a content slurry, diminishing the social aspects of Twitter.
- Subcultures are being homogenized by the algorithm, leading to cultural antagonism.
- Vulnerability on Twitter has become risky due to the unpredictable audience the algorithm creates.
- Engagement is prioritized by the algorithm, regardless of whether it is positive or negative.
- Users often lack awareness of how the algorithm affects their interactions on Twitter.
- The shift to an algorithmic timeline is seen as a response to declining user engagement post-Elon Musk's acquisition.
- Twitter historically fostered diverse subcultures, which are now threatened by the algorithm.
- The community aspect of Twitter is being eroded, resulting in a loss of meaningful connections.
- The author reflects on their emotional attachment to Twitter and the community it fostered.
- Algorithms are indifferent to the emotional impact of content, which can exacerbate outrage and negativity.
- The loss of Twitter's original social fabric is viewed as tragic and unnecessary by many users.
- Alternative platforms attempt to replicate Twitter's magic but fall short in capturing its unique essence.
- Social awareness and emotional regulation are crucial skills for navigating Twitter's current landscape.
- The importance of understanding and controlling one's reactions to the online environment is emphasized.

- "If that’s you… please heal your heart."
- "It’s just tragic. And it’s so unnecessary, that’s what upsets us all."
