## SUMMARY
Quanta Magazine discusses how statisticians address missing data using techniques like multiple imputation, developed by Donald Rubin, to improve research accuracy.

## IDEAS:
- Missing data is a common issue in various fields, including social and biological sciences.
- Traditional methods, like complete case analysis, can introduce bias by excluding incomplete data.
- Single imputation, while better than ignoring data, can lead to overconfidence in results.
- Donald Rubin proposed multiple imputation in the 1970s as a more accurate method for handling missing data.
- Multiple imputation involves making several guesses about missing data and analyzing each guess separately.
- This technique allows researchers to account for uncertainty in their predictions.
- Multiple imputation has become the standard approach in fields like medicine and social science.
- Advances in computer technology have made multiple imputation more accessible to individual researchers.
- Software for multiple imputation has evolved, including machine learning tools for complex data sets.
- The FDA has recommended multiple imputation over older methods due to its rigor and versatility.
- Despite its benefits, some researchers remain cautious about newer machine learning methods for imputation.
- Randomness in statistical methods can lead to more honest interpretations of data.
- Rubin's approach has influenced data analysis across various disciplines, including drug testing and political research.
- The initial resistance to multiple imputation highlights the challenges of changing established practices in research.
- Multiple imputation can help avoid skewed results that misrepresent the effectiveness of treatments.
- The method has implications for regulatory processes, influencing drug approvals based on accurate uncertainty estimates.

## QUOTES:
- “We cannot calculate with missing data, just as we can’t divide by zero.” – Stef van Buuren
- “If you leave out the people who didn’t complete the study, you’re excluding the cases where your drug did the worst.” 
- “Single imputation avoided the bias of complete case analysis, but it had its own flaw: overconfidence.”
- “Don’t just impute once. Impute multiple times.” – Donald Rubin
- “Being accurate about that uncertainty is crucial: It influences whether or not a drug will get approved.”
- “Multiple imputation is the most general: It works any time you might have otherwise tried to use single imputation.”
- “Rubin evangelized his method throughout the 1970s and ’80s.”
- “Multiple imputation turned out to be both rigorous and versatile.”

## FACTS:
- Data incompleteness is prevalent in clinical trials, surveys, and economic reports.
- Single imputation dates back to 1930 and was commonly used by the 1960s.
- Multiple imputation became widely adopted in the 1990s as computer processing power increased.
- A 2010 FDA report strongly recommended against single imputation methods.
- The development of multiple imputation software has facilitated its use in research.
- Machine learning techniques for imputation are being explored in fields beyond social sciences, like engineering.
- Rubin's method has been implemented in various governmental organizations for data analysis.
- The challenges of managing large data sets were significant before advancements in technology.
