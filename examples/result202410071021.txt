# SUMMARY
A blog post by N. Tietz discusses the lack of a comprehensive web framework for Rust, advocating for a toolkit to simplify web development.

# IDEAS:
- Rust currently lacks a web framework that minimizes setup for developers.
- Existing frameworks require extensive wiring, making them cumbersome for quick projects.
- A framework should bundle essential features like routing, templates, and static file serving.
- Developer experience could be greatly improved with hot reloading and background tasks.
- There is a need for a unified approach to managing logins and permissions.
- The Rust ecosystem has many libraries but lacks a cohesive framework that integrates them all.
- The author envisions a toolkit that streamlines the process of creating web applications in Rust.
- A good web framework should offer excellent documentation and support for breaking changes.
- The proposed toolkit is named "nicole's web toolkit" or `newt`.
- The goal of `newt` is to enable rapid web app development in minutes, not days.
- Monitoring and caching should be considered for long-term projects.
- The author hopes for a collaborative ecosystem with multiple toolkits available.
- Current frameworks are either minimalist or single-page app focused but don’t meet the author's needs.
- A strong type system and performance are key benefits of using Rust for web development.
- Building a comprehensive web framework for Rust could attract more developers to the language.
- The author expresses a desire for community involvement in developing the toolkit.

# QUOTES:
- "I like to make silly things, and I also like to put in _minimal effort_ for those silly things."
- "Rust needs something that _does_ bundle this up for you, so that we can serve all web developers."
- "You almost always need some way to log in, since apps are usually multi-user or deployed on a public network."
- "Hot reloading is a _huge_ one for developer experience."
- "There needs to be a story for background tasks!"
- "It will make your life so much easier when you have it in that moment that you desperately need it."
- "Each of these is excellent for what it is—but what it is requires a lot of wiring up still."
- "I’d much rather have a single web framework that handles it all, with clean upgrade instructions between versions."
- "In an ideal world, there would be a framework for Rust that gives me all the features I listed above."
- "I'm thinking of it as a _web toolkit_: a bundle of tools tastefully chosen and arranged to make the artisan highly effective."
- "The goal for `newt` is to be able to create a new small web app and start on the actual project in minutes instead of days."
- "A healthy ecosystem will have multiple such toolkits, and I hope to see others develop as well."
- "If this post was enjoyable or useful for you, **please share it!**"
- "I hope someone else builds one, too, so we can have multiple options."
- "I think that Rust really needs this, and the whole ecosystem will benefit from it."

# FACTS:
- Django is perceived as too complex for non-commercial projects.
- The Rust community currently favors a "wire it up yourself" approach.
- The author has previously built a digital vigil using the Yew framework.
- Monitoring and observability are essential for all but the smallest systems.
- Many existing libraries in Rust are often outdated or poorly integrated.
- Each project typically requires maintenance of multiple frameworks or libraries.
- Rust offers a strong type system and performance advantages for web development.
- Single-page app frameworks in Rust are still maturing.
- The ecosystem has multiple minimalist frameworks like actix-web and axum.
- The author believes that excellent documentation is crucial for a successful framework.
- The concept of a toolkit aims to simplify the integration of existing libraries.
- Background tasks are a common requirement for web applications.
- Logins and permissions are often cumbersome to implement in web projects.
- Deployment tooling is necessary for seamless application setup.
- Static file serving is essential for local development and small-time deployments.
- The author has a public repository for their toolkit, though it is not yet usable.

# RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Consider developing a comprehensive web framework that integrates essential features.
- Implement hot reloading to improve developer experience.
- Create a unified approach for managing user logins and permissions.
- Develop background task support to streamline feature scheduling.
- Ensure the framework comes with thorough documentation and changelogs.
- Explore the possibility of bundling CSS/JS for seamless integration.
- Encourage community collaboration in developing the proposed toolkit.
- Focus on making the toolkit usable for quick project setups.
- Highlight the performance benefits of using Rust in web development.
- Regularly update libraries to avoid maintenance burdens.
- Introduce monitoring and observability as standard features in web apps.
- Foster a culture of sharing and open-source collaboration within the Rust community.
- Aim for a toolkit that appeals to both new and experienced developers.
- Ensure that the toolkit is easily extensible for future needs.
- Promote the toolkit through blogs and community forums to gather feedback.
- Consider the needs of non-commercial developers when designing features.
