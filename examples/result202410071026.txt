# SUMMARY
The Electronic Frontier Foundation discusses how to prevent advertisers from tracking teens online, emphasizing the risks posed by Advertising IDs and data brokers.

# IDEAS:
- Teens aged 13-17 are particularly vulnerable to online tracking.
- Advertising IDs are unique identifiers that allow advertisers to track user behavior across devices.
- The transition to managing their own accounts at 13 exposes teens to data collection.
- Deleting Advertising IDs can significantly enhance privacy for minors.
- Schools should educate students and parents about online privacy and data protection.
- Data brokers collect information from various sources including social media and shopping history.
- The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) does not protect teens over 13.
- Teens lose important privacy protections as they age out of COPPA.
- Both Android and iOS provide options to delete or reset Advertising IDs.
- Teens can still see ads after deleting their Advertising ID, but they will be less targeted.
- Advertising tracking can lead to a significant loss of personal privacy and autonomy.
- Advocating for extended privacy protections can benefit everyone, not just minors.
- Many teens lie about their age to access social media platforms.
- The number of apps requesting tracking permission has increased with the rise of targeted advertising.
- Advertisers use a combination of location data, app usage, and browsing history for targeted ads.
- Teens often experience a stark change in online privacy as they transition to adolescence.
