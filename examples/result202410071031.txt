# SUMMARY
Students Youssef Nader, Luke Farritor, and Julian Schilliger decoded ancient texts from Herculaneum using AI and GitHub tools, winning the Vesuvius Challenge.

# IDEAS:
- The use of AI tools like GitHub Copilot significantly accelerated the process of decoding ancient texts.
- Collaboration across different time zones was essential for the students' success in the challenge.
- The Vesuvius Challenge aimed to foster innovation in deciphering the Herculaneum Papyri.
- AI technology allowed researchers to detect ink on carbonized scrolls that traditional methods could not.
- The competition attracted hundreds of engineers globally, showcasing the potential of collective intelligence.
- Overcoming the challenges of virtual collaboration led to memorable experiences among team members.
- The students' success highlights the intersection of technology, history, and education.
- The project inspired students to pursue careers at the intersection of coding and historical research.
- Engaging with the community through platforms like Discord enhanced teamwork and knowledge sharing.
- The initiative emphasizes the importance of open-source collaboration in solving complex problems.
- The experience was life-changing for the students, providing them with mentors and career opportunities.
- The historical significance of the texts decoded has implications for understanding ancient cultures.
- The integration of AI in historical research could lead to further discoveries in the future.
- The challenge encourages students to utilize GitHub’s resources and tools for educational purposes.
- The students' journey reflects the potential of youth to contribute significantly to academic research.
- The use of advanced imaging technology, such as tomography and X-rays, was crucial in the initial stages of the project.

# QUOTES:
- “There are so many benefits to using GitHub as a student, from a free GitHub Pro account to the use of GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code.” - Julian Schilliger
- “We were working in different time zones, so sometimes, we had to intentionally overlap with each other which led to some very late nights and early mornings.” - Youssef Nader
- “I had almost given up hope. I had tried so many different things. In the morning, I was running one last experiment and to my surprise, it worked.” - Youssef Nader
- “This challenge from the very beginning was to foster collaboration even in the face of competition.” - Youssef Nader
- “I saw this young student in front of me. It amazed me as I was expecting someone older.” - Gianluca Del Mastro
- “Youssef, Luke, and I won this grand prize, but this is only a small piece in the ongoing efforts to decode the scrolls.” - Julian Schilliger

# FACTS:
- The Herculaneum Papyri were buried under ashes from the eruption of Mount Vesuvius 2,000 years ago.
- The Vesuvius Challenge was launched in March 2023 to promote decoding these ancient texts.
- The scrolls are carbonized and cannot be opened without disintegrating, making traditional decoding impossible.
- The competition offered a total of $700,000 in prizes to the participants.
- The technology for virtual unwrapping scrolls has been developed over several decades.
- A breakthrough in 2015 allowed the reading of a scroll from the Dead Sea Scrolls collection.
- The students' team was recognized for decoding around 1600 cm² of the scrolls.
- Many researchers have been working on these texts since as early as 1754 AD.
