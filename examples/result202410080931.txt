- New exceptions like `PythonFinalizationError` were introduced for better error handling.
- The `argparse` module now supports deprecation of command-line options.
- Python 3.13 officially supports iOS and Android as platforms.
- New typing features include support for default values in type parameters.
- The `dbm` module now uses SQLite as its default backend.
- The `os` module includes new functions for working with Linux's timer notification file descriptors.
- The `copy` module introduces a `copy.replace()` function for easier object modification.
- The new `random` module includes a command-line interface.
- Improved handling of Unicode and string formatting in various modules.
- Performance optimizations have reduced import times for standard library modules.
- The environment variable `PYTHON_COLORS` controls color output in the interpreter.
- The `warnings` module now includes a `deprecated()` decorator for better deprecation handling.
- The interactive interpreter now supports multiline editing and direct REPL commands.
- The `ssl` module has updated default verification flags for enhanced security.
- The `statistics` module adds functions for kernel density estimation.
- New functions for encoding and decoding Z85 data have been introduced in the `base64` module.
- Many modules now support additional keyword arguments for improved functionality.

### QUOTES:
- "Python 3.13 is the latest stable release of the Python programming language, with a mix of changes to the language, the implementation and the standard library."
