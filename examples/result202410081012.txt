# SUMMARY
The Aegir project, created by an amateur electronics enthusiast, details a custom GPS tracker for remote expeditions using LTE and Iridium networks.

# IDEAS:
- The Aegir GPS tracker was designed for remote locations with no mobile coverage.
- The project was tested on the expedition yacht S/Y Southern Star in the Arctic.
- Communication in remote areas is facilitated through Iridium technology.
- The tracker can send location data every 10 seconds when LTE is available.
- In areas without LTE, it sends data hourly using Iridium.
- The device incorporates a microcontroller (STM32) and various communication modules.
- The firmware for the tracker was developed using FreeRTOS.
- The project required knowledge of electronics, programming, and navigation.
- The author created a previous application called GPXLAB for drawing GPX tracks.
- The tracker can save data points to an SD card for later use.
- It is designed to be powered by 12V DC with backup power for emergencies.
- The device was tested during a sailing expedition from Tromsø to Svalbard.
- The tracker performed well in coastal waters with consistent LTE coverage.
- Costs associated with Iridium communication were a concern for future use.
- The author learned valuable skills in STM programming and FreeRTOS.
- The prototype was first assembled on a breadboard before final PCB design.
- The project was motivated by the opportunity to join an Arctic sailing expedition.
- The design includes a case made from polycarbonate for environmental protection.
- The tracker uses a combination of GPS, LTE, and Iridium technologies.
- The final device was assembled after overcoming various design challenges.
- The author’s experiences highlight the importance of preparation for remote travel.

# QUOTES:
- "The ultimate motivator for building this project was the opportunity to join the crew of the S/Y Southern Star yacht."
- "The firmware could have been done better, it's not perfect but the time constraints were strict and after all it is a hobby project."
- "In such places, the only real way to communicate with the world is through Iridium."
- "The tracker sent data to the server every 10 seconds in the coastal waters, meaning that the entire Norwegian fjords had LTE coverage."
- "The project essentially concludes with this expedition."
- "For me, this was the most challenging electronic project I have completed so far."
- "There were some errors, but a few trace cuts and jumpers solved the problem."
- "I had a pleasure to talk about the project for Elektroda.pl podcast."
- "Communication is done via UART using dedicated AT commands."
- "The project was motivated by the plan for a sailing expedition to Svalbard."

# FACTS:
- Iridium technology is essential for communication in remote polar areas.
- The device can operate in about 170 countries with its LTE module.
- The tracker was tested successfully in Arctic conditions.
- A GPS fix can be acquired in about a minute with 4 or more satellites.
- The Iridium module can only send data every few minutes when a satellite is overhead.
- The author has experience traveling extensively by motorcycle and 4x4.
- A GPS antenna filter limits the usage of other GNSS systems.
- The project utilized public components available in EasyEDA for PCB design.
- The tracker has a backup power module allowing for approximately 2 hours of operation.
- The author documented the journey and results of the project on various platforms.
