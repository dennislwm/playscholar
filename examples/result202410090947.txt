# SUMMARY
The article by Dynomight discusses the implications of AI's data wall, comparing human and AI learning processes and emphasizing evolution's role in intelligence development.

# IDEAS:
- AI's rapid development may face a "data wall" as it approaches the limits of available text data.
- Humans generalize from significantly less language data than AI models.
- The argument that humans leverage other modalities (visual, tactile) for language acquisition is questioned.
- Evolution provides humans with sophisticated programming that aids in learning and intelligence.
- The information contained in human DNA may hold more significance than previously thought.
- Human intelligence is shaped by both evolutionary and experiential learning processes.
- The complexity of human learning strategies may not be easily replicable in AI.
- The efficiency of human learning could stem from millions of years of evolutionary adaptation.
- AI training differs from human learning in the nature of the learning algorithms and data sources.
- The physical structure of cells and DNA contributes to embodied information beyond genetic coding.
- The analogy of AI learning from data versus human learning from experience oversimplifies the complexities involved.
- Evolutionary history integrates vast amounts of information that influence human intelligence.
- AI models have the potential to utilize visual data despite human strategies not requiring it.
- The author's skepticism towards the data wall does not negate the possibility of algorithmic progress.
- The effectiveness of human learning strategies could be difficult to replicate due to their complexity.
- The outer loop of evolution has had more iterations than the machine learning outer loop.
- Human learning may involve a combination of simple and complex algorithms.
- The amount of information in AI datasets may include much irrelevant data.
- Humans learn through a "double-loop" optimization process involving both evolution and individual experience.
- The article emphasizes the importance of direct arguments for AI learning strategies rather than relying on human comparisons.

# QUOTES:
- "If trends hold, we are in for quite a show."
- "Current language models are trained on datasets fast approaching 'all the text, ever'."
- "Imagine a fast reader who did nothing but read 300 words/minute for 80 years."
- "It seems unlikely that intelligence would be based on smell or proprioception."
- "The issue with this analogy is that humans are born with extremely sophisticated programming, provided by evolution."
- "Your intelligence is based on 'data' from your whole evolutionary history, not just your lifetime."
- "DNA has lots of other jobs beyond intelligence, like making ribosomes or making teeth."
- "Evolution provides lots of other information beyond just what’s written down in the DNA."
- "The most important difference between these is that the evolution outer loop has executed many, many more times."
- "Just because humans learn efficiently doesn’t necessarily mean their strategy will be easy to copy."
- "If you want to argue for visual data or algorithmic progress, a direct argument is more convincing than gesturing at some human babies."

# FACTS:
- The average person reads a few thousand words and hears 16 to 40 thousand words daily.
- A well-educated 40-year-old may encounter 5×10⁸ words in their lifetime.
- Recent language models are trained on upwards of ~10¹² to 10¹³ words.
- Claude Shannon estimated English text averages 11.8 bits/word.
- Modern language models suggest text may contain only 2.3 bits/word.
- Human DNA consists of around 2.9 billion base pairs.
- Information in human DNA is approximately 690 megabytes.
- Tactile signing can aid language acquisition for those who are deafblind.
- Evolution has optimized human learning strategies over millions of years.
- AI models learn from data, while human babies learn from experience.

- Encourage direct arguments for learning strategies rather than relying on human analogies.
- Experiment with alternative modalities for AI learning beyond traditional text data.
- Examine how embodied information in physical structures affects intelligence.
- Reflect on the efficiency of human learning as a model for AI development.
- Engage with philosophical discussions around AI and human intelligence.
- Stay informed about advancements in AI and evolutionary biology.
