# SUMMARY
Kristoff discusses the paradox of static sites versus complex CMS solutions, advocating for web simplicity to make it more accessible to non-engineers.

# IDEAS:
- Most normal users struggle with complicated CMS solutions rather than opting for simpler static sites.
- Professionals often find it easier to set up complex systems due to familiarity with technology.
- The simplicity of static sites is often overshadowed by the complexity of setting them up.
- Many normal users are trapped by expensive hosting solutions that complicate their web presence.
- Complexity in web development pushes users toward social networks instead of personal websites.
- A lack of tools for vanilla HTML leads developers to use unnecessary frameworks.
- The web's complexity disconnects it from non-engineers, hindering broader participation.
- Software engineers enjoy free hosting options while normal users face financial barriers.
- The dominance of frameworks can lead to unnecessary complexity in projects.
- The web used to foster diversity in its creators, which is diminishing.

# QUOTES:
- "Weird as it might be, it's not a great mystery why that is: it's easier to spin up a Wordpress blog than it is to figure out by yourself all the intermediate steps."
- "The more we make the web complex, the more we push normal users into the enclosures that we like to call social networks."
- "Whenever we fail to make simple things easy in software engineering, and webdev especially, we are failing society in the exact same way."
- "It's a bit sad that this is the case."
- "Don't you find it infuriating when lawyers and accountants fail to clarify how their respective domains work, making them unavoidable intermediaries?"

# FACTS:
- The first language server for HTML was created by Kristoff.
- Many normal users rely on costly hosting solutions while engineers benefit from free options like GitHub Pages.
- Linters for HTML diagnostics exist but are often tied to specific frameworks.
- Static websites could suffice for 99% of cases but are often overlooked.
- The economic incentives of startups and big tech are misaligned with simplifying web access.

# REFERENCES:
- Kristoff's blog post about the first HTML language server.
- His talk at SquiggleConf in Boston.
- Mention of SuperHTML and its recognition on Hacker News.
- Link to a TechCrunch article discussing WordPress hosting issues.

# RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Encourage the development of tools that simplify static site creation for all users.
- Promote awareness of the advantages of static websites over complex CMSs.
- Advocate for the inclusion of vanilla HTML tools in development environments.
- Support initiatives that make web development more accessible to non-engineers.
- Foster a community that values simplicity and diversity in web creation.
