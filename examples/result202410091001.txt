## SUMMARY
The article discusses the implications of a recent strike by dockworkers over automation at U.S. ports, highlighting performance issues and ongoing negotiations.

## IDEAS:
- The International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) went on strike demanding a ban on new port automation.
- The strike ended with a tentative agreement on wages, but automation negotiations continue.
- Historically, dockworker unions have resisted automation that enhances productivity.
- High wages of longshoremen contribute to negative perceptions of their demands.
- The performance of U.S. ports is poor compared to global counterparts.
- Few ports globally are automated, challenging the assumption that automation directly correlates with performance.
- The World Bank's Container Port Performance Index ranks U.S. ports poorly.
- The largest U.S. ports, such as Los Angeles and Long Beach, rank near the bottom in efficiency.
- The U.S. has the worst-performing ports of any country according to the World Bank index.
- Other factors, not just automation, contribute to poor port performance in the U.S.

## QUOTES:
- "The ILA demanded a complete ban on introducing new port automation."
- "The strike ended on October 3rd with a tentative agreement on wage increases."
- "Most folks have reasonably assumed that the union is holding back port automation."
- "Harold Daggett has complained about EZ passes for highway tolls eliminating union jobs."
- "The case for port automation isn’t straightforward."
- "Few ports around the world are automated, and the most heavily automated ports don’t necessarily perform the best."
- "On average, per this index the U.S. has the worst-performing ports of any country in the world."
- "Major American ports routinely rank near the bottom of this list."
- "Los Angeles, the largest port in the U.S. by container volume, ranked #375 in 2023."
- "Only New York-New Jersey cracked the top 100 at #92."

## FACTS:
- The ILA strike involved 47,000 dockworkers primarily on East and Gulf Coast ports.
- The strike occurred after failure to agree on contract terms with USMX.
- The Container Port Performance Index was released by the World Bank in 2020.
- Los Angeles and Long Beach are the largest ports by container volume in the U.S.
- Savannah ranked #395 and Seattle ranked #360 on the World Bank index.
- The U.S. ports perform poorly compared to global standards.
- The ILA president has alleged ties to organized crime.
- The negotiations over automation will continue until January 15th.
- Historically, dockworkers protested against the introduction of shipping containers.
- The ILA's demands are partly fueled by concerns over job security due to automation.

## RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Consider the historical context of dockworker resistance to automation.
