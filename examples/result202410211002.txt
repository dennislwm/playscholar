In this blog post, 1Password explains the controversy surrounding the SSO tax, which is when software vendors charge a premium for Single Sign-On services, often leading to outrage and debate among users.

- The SSO tax refers to vendors significantly increasing prices for Single Sign-On access.
- Critics liken this to buying a car but paying extra for seatbelts, which should be standard.
- Vendors, on the other hand, argue that SSO is a luxury feature, similar to a sunroof.
- In reality, SSO is more like a rearview camera—initially seen as an upgrade but now essential for security.
- Many believe it’s unfair to charge for a security feature, especially with rising cyber threats.
- Companies want SSO to simplify access and improve security, making it vital for their operations.
- Without SSO, employees face the hassle of managing numerous passwords, increasing the risk of breaches.
- The SSO tax can lead to significant budget increases for businesses, sometimes over 5,000%.
- Even with rising costs, many companies still lack SSO protection, making them vulnerable to attacks.
- Vendors justify the SSO tax by claiming it covers the costs of building and maintaining the service.
- However, critics argue that the markups far exceed the actual costs of implementing SSO.
- Some vendors have chosen not to charge this tax, hoping to build a better reputation and trust.
- Industry experts suggest that charging for essential security features undermines overall security standards.
- There’s also a strong argument that an SSO tax goes against the principles of product-led growth.
- Companies struggling with the SSO tax can negotiate for better pricing or utilize password managers as alternatives.
- The ongoing debate about the SSO tax highlights a broader issue in software pricing and security practices.
- Ultimately, raising awareness and public pressure is crucial for changing this unfair practice.

The SSO tax is a stark reminder of how essential security features can become unjustly priced luxuries, and it’s time for change!
