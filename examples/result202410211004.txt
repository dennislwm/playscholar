In this fascinating exploration, a team discovers that the order of fields in a compound index can drastically enhance database query performance.

- The team faced a problem with an endpoint that slowed down from under 30ms to around 500ms.
- Their query involved filtering by status and event type, then ordering by a timestamp.
- They had a compound index but it wasn't structured efficiently for their needs.
- Initially, they added a missing field to the index, hoping to see a significant performance boost.
- Unfortunately, this change only resulted in a modest improvement of about 50ms.
- They learned that the order of fields in the index was crucial for efficiency.
- The leftmost fields of an index should narrow the search space to improve query speed.
- Their original index prioritized the order by the timestamp, which wasn't ideal for filtering.
- By restructuring the index to prioritize status and event type first, they aimed to reduce the workload for the database.
- This new approach allowed Postgres to efficiently target only the relevant records.
- After deploying the changes, the query latency plummeted to under 10ms, a remarkable improvement.
- The team's success highlighted the importance of understanding database internals for optimization.
- They left with a valuable lesson about the impact of index structure on performance.
- Now, they invite others to share their own experiences with database optimizations.

In summary, by understanding and adjusting the order of their index fields, they achieved a stunning performance boost that transformed their system's efficiency!

# SUMMARY
Jay Why discusses optimizing a compound index in Postgres, reducing query latency from ~500ms to sub 10ms by reordering index fields.

# IDEAS:
- Initial latency of the endpoint increased from under 30ms to ~500ms over time.
- The query involved filtering by `status` and `event_type`, and ordering by `occurred_at`.
- A compound index was initially in place but was insufficient for performance.
- Adding a field to the index did not yield significant improvements.
- The order of fields in the index can drastically impact query performance.
- Efficient indexes reduce the number of records that need to be scanned.
- Postgres prefers leading index fields that narrow search space.
- The original index structure required scanning millions of `occurred_at` values.
- The final index structure prioritized `status`, followed by `event_type`, and then `occurred_at`.
- The new index structure allowed Postgres to optimize its search process.
- Implementing the new index structure led to a drastic latency reduction.
- Understanding Postgres's internal data structures improved query optimization.
- The experience was both challenging and rewarding, enhancing knowledge of Postgres.
- The blog invites readers to share their own experiences with Postgres.
- The importance of proper index design is emphasized for database performance.
- A compound index can lead to significant performance improvements when structured correctly.
- The visual aids used in the article clarify the impact of index structure.
- The author highlights the satisfaction of seeing dramatic performance improvements.
- Real-time processing of subscription events relies on low-latency queries.
- The article serves as a practical case study for database optimization techniques.

# QUOTES:
- "We needed our system to process that event so we could provision them with the purchased features."
- "The index field order determines the number of records that must be scanned."
- "An efficient index will drastically reduce the number of records that need to be scanned."
- "The index is most efficient when there are constraints on the leading (leftmost) columns."
- "We were asking Postgres to check _every_ `occurred_at` value!"
- "This feels a lot lighter for Postgres… in theory… but.. will it work?"
- "Seeing your application aspire to be a sky diver without a parachute is extremely gratifying."
- "A better understanding of how Postgres handles compound indexes and the importance of field ordering helped us significantly optimize our query."
- "The result? A drastic improvement in performance, with the endpoint now performing under 10ms."

# FACTS:
- The initial query performance was under 30ms.
- The query latency increased to ~500ms over a couple of months.
- The database table had a few million rows.
- The `status` field had four possible values.
- The `event_type` field had around 100 different values.
- The query was filtering by two fields and sorting by one.
- Postgres's performance can be affected by the order of fields in an index.
- Effective indexing can lead to significant improvements in database query speed.
