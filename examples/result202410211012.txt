In this insightful piece, the author simplifies the complex world of AI use cases into three main categories: Gods, Interns, and Cogs, making it easier for everyone to understand.

- The author discusses the overwhelming variety of AI applications out there.
- He introduces three buckets for categorizing AI: Gods, Interns, and Cogs.
- **Gods** represent super-intelligent entities that might replace humans in tasks.
- They require enormous resources and breakthroughs, making them rare and highly anticipated.
- **Interns** are like helpful assistants who work under the supervision of experts.
- They handle the tedious tasks, allowing professionals to focus on bigger ideas.
- Tools like GitHub Copilot and Adobe Firefly are examples of these Interns in action.
- There's a fun subcategory called **Toys**, which are non-expert tools for entertainment.
- Finally, **Cogs** are specialized functions that perform specific tasks very efficiently.
- They have low error tolerance and are commonly used in business settings.
- This framework helps clarify the confusing landscape of AI use cases.
- By categorizing them, it's easier to identify strengths, weaknesses, and potential improvements.
- The author emphasizes that understanding these categories aids in meaningful discussions about AI.

In conclusion, recognizing the distinctions between Gods, Interns, and Cogs makes navigating the AI landscape more manageable and exciting!

## SUMMARY
Drew Breunig discusses AI use cases categorized as Gods, Interns, and Cogs, simplifying the complex landscape of artificial intelligence applications.

## IDEAS:
- AI use cases can be simplified into three categories: Gods, Interns, and Cogs.
- **Gods** represent super-intelligent AI that operates autonomously.
- Achieving **Gods** requires significant resources, research, and funding.
- The impact of **Gods** is mostly felt through hype and regulation rather than practical application.
- **Interns** function as supervised copilots, assisting experts with tasks.
- Tools like Github Copilot and Adobe Firefly exemplify **Interns** in various domains.
- The productivity boost from **Interns** can lead to reduced hiring needs in tech companies.
- **Interns** are primarily valuable when paired with expert users.
- **Toys** are a subcategory of **Interns**, used for entertainment with less reliance on expert input.
- **Cogs** are specialized functions that perform single tasks reliably and autonomously.
- The focus on **Cogs** leads to their dominance in enterprise AI applications.
- Cloud platforms are rapidly developing tools for building and managing **Cogs**.
- Categorizing AI use cases helps navigate the complexity of the field.
- Effective communication is crucial for discussions about emergent technologies like AI.
- The language surrounding AI is still evolving, complicating conversations.
- Understanding the distinctions between these categories can streamline discussions and problem-solving.

## QUOTES:
- "Gods are the human-replacement use cases."
- "Interns are the copilots... used and supervised by experts."
- "Interns are focused on the grunt work."
- "Today, Interns are delivering the lion’s share of the realized value from AI."
- "If Turntable is sloppy with a line or two, the artist can drop in and tweak it."
- "Cogs are designed to do one task, unsupervised, very well."
- "Cogs have a low tolerance for errors because they run with little expert oversight."
- "AI looks like just another pipeline function."
- "Sorting the ocean of AI use cases into the Gods, Interns, and Cogs buckets has helped me tremendously."
- "It’s challenging to work in emergent fields as the language has yet to settle."
- "Communication challenges are a tax that must be dealt with before productive conversations can occur."

## FACTS:
- The concept of artificial general intelligence (AGI) is often discussed but remains elusive.
- Massive funding rounds for AI ventures can influence public perception and regulation.
- Tools like Github Copilot and Adobe Firefly have significantly changed productivity in their respective fields.
- Companies are reportedly slowing down hiring due to the efficiency of AI tools.
- AI use cases are often misunderstood by laypeople due to their complexity.
- Cloud platforms are increasingly focusing on the development of **Cogs**.
- The AI landscape is filled with both hype and genuine innovation.
- Cogs are often built using smaller, fine-tuned models.
- The categorization of AI tools helps in identifying their specific applications and limitations.
- Emergent fields like AI require clear communication to foster understanding and collaboration.
