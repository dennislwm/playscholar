In this insightful article, Geoff Huston explores the long and complex journey of transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6, highlighting the challenges and implications of this ongoing process.

- The author reflects on a previous article about the IPv6 transition from 2022.
- He notes that despite the transition starting over 25 years ago, many still rely on IPv4.
- Currently, only about one-third of users can access IPv6-only services.
- The Internet is functioning with over 20 billion devices, despite only 3 billion unique IPv4 addresses.
- IPv6 was designed to provide enough addresses for all devices, yet adoption remains slow.
- The transition is hindered by a lack of urgency and tangible benefits for companies.
- Current trends predict full IPv6 adoption could take until 2045 if things don’t change.
- Historically, the Internet was built on scarce resources, making IPv6 essential for future growth.
- However, the rise of NATs and other technologies has alleviated some of the urgency for IPv6.
- As of now, many applications still prefer IPv4, slowing down the transition.
- The architecture of the Internet has shifted to focus more on services than strict address-based systems.
- This change means many services can operate without unique public IP addresses.
- The author questions if unique addressing is still necessary in an increasingly service-oriented Internet.
- The article concludes that the dual-stack environment may persist for the foreseeable future.

The transition to IPv6 is far from over, raising intriguing questions about the future of Internet architecture and addressing.

## SUMMARY
Geoff Huston discusses the ongoing transition to IPv6, its slow adoption, and implications for the future of internet architecture in this October 2024 column.

## IDEAS:
- The transition to IPv6 has been ongoing for over 25 years, yet only about one-third of users can access IPv6-only services.
- Despite IPv4 exhaustion, the internet continues to function largely on IPv4 due to address sharing.
- IPv6 was designed as a conservative update to IPv4, primarily to prevent address exhaustion, without offering significant performance improvements.
- The lack of urgency in transitioning to IPv6 is partly due to perceived costs versus benefits.
- Predictions suggest the transition to IPv6 could take until 2045 to complete.
- The internet has shifted away from strict address-based architecture, relying more on names and services than unique IP addresses.
- Increased use of NATs has allowed the internet to support billions of devices without requiring unique IPv4 addresses for each.
- The market price for IPv4 addresses has stabilized, indicating a balance between supply and demand.
- IPv6 adoption rates show stagnation in certain regions, raising questions about future momentum.
- The architecture of the internet is evolving to prioritize application-level functions over network-level addressing.
- The dual stack approach (supporting both IPv4 and IPv6) may remain indefinitely due to the absence of clear incentives to complete the transition.
- Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) have changed the way services are delivered, reducing reliance on direct IP addressing.
- Advances in processing and storage technologies have transformed the economics of internet services.
- The internet's operational paradigm has shifted from scarcity to abundance, making traditional address-based architecture less relevant.
- The role of unique global endpoint addressing is being questioned as service delivery becomes more localized.
- The future of the internet may not depend on unique addressing but rather on common referential mechanisms.

## QUOTES:
- "We are only at a level where slightly more than one third of the Internet’s user base can access an IPv6-only service."
- "The original 'end-to-end' architecture of the Internet assumed that every device was uniquely addressed."
- "IPv6 was meant to address these issues, and the 128-bit wide address fields in the protocol has sufficient address space to allow every connected device to use its own unique address."
- "The major benefit of IPv6 was to mitigate the future risk of IPv4 address exhaustion."
- "If the growth trend of IPv6 adoption continues at its current rate, how long will it take for every device to be IPv6 capable?"
- "This model predicts a continuation of this transition for a further two decades."
- "IPv6 alone is not critical to a large set of end user service delivery environments."
- "The entire concept of IPv6 was to restore a coherent address plan across the collection of Internet-connected devices."
- "The economics of the Internet has shifted up the protocol stack to the level of applications and services."
- "What defines the Internet? Is a common shared transmission fabric still relevant?"
- "There seems to be no appetite to resolve this situation by completing the transition any time soon."

## FACTS:
- RFC 2460, the first specification of the IPv6 protocol, was published in December 1998.
- Over 20 billion devices are estimated to be using the internet by late 2024.
- The IPv4 routing table encompasses about 3.03 billion unique IPv4 addresses.
- IPv6 adoption rose from 0.5% to 17.4% between 2012 and early 2018.
- As of 2024, the price of traded IPv4 addresses has stabilized between $30 to $40 per address.
- Approximately 47% of the top 1000 websites are reachable over IPv6.
- The largest production chips in 2024, like the Apple M3, have up to 92 billion transistors.
- The concept of Network Address Translation (NAT) gained traction in the early 1990s to alleviate address scarcity.
- The deployment of IPv6 was significantly hindered by the rapid growth of mobile services.
- The use of NATs has allowed for a more efficient use of IPv4 addresses.
