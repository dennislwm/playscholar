In this fascinating exploration, we delve into the mysterious scratches found in Stanley Kubrick's _2001: A Space Odyssey_, revealing their origins and significance.

- The discussion revolves around a unique set of scratches in _2001: A Space Odyssey_.
- These scratches are not simply damage but were actually filmed during production in the mid-1960s.
- They appear consistently across various formats of the film, from VHS to Blu-ray.
- Notably, they can be spotted on a computer screen displaying the "COM" label during key scenes.
- The scratches are most visible during the "Jupiter Mission" sequence, particularly inside the EVA pods.
- They flash by at specific moments when the "COM" logo is displayed, especially during dramatic scenes.
- Interestingly, these scratches are absent from cropped versions of the film made for TV.
- Some later restorations seem to have digitally removed these scratches, raising questions about preservation choices.
- The scratches are visible in the 2018 "unrestored" 70 mm print, suggesting they are part of the original material.
- This leads to deeper questions about film restoration and what it means to preserve the original work.
- The production team faced challenges creating realistic computer readouts, which were achieved through innovative analog techniques.
- The team used 16 mm loops for animation, projecting them behind the screens on set.
- This method not only created the iconic visuals but also added a layer of authenticity to the technology depicted in the film.
- The scratches themselves represent the imperfections of the film medium, contrasting with the futuristic themes of the movie.
- This prompts a reflection on the relationship between old and new media, and how we perceive the original film experience today.

In conclusion, the scratches in _2001: A Space Odyssey_ are not just blemishes but a testament to the film's production history, prompting us to reconsider how we engage with classic cinema.

## SUMMARY
The article by Aphelis discusses the notable scratches in Stanley Kubrick's _2001: A Space Odyssey_, which were filmed during production and appear across multiple editions.

## IDEAS:
- The scratches are integral to the film, visible in various formats since production.
- They occur during scenes featuring the "COM" computer display in the EVA pods.
- The scratches are absent in cropped TV versions and some digitally cleaned editions.
- The scratches were likely created during filming, specifically on 16 mm loops used for rear projection.
- Visible in both VHS and Blu-ray editions, but not in all.
- The same set of scratches appears in both the "Pod 1" and "Pod 2" sequences.
- The "COM" display shows a wave-like graph before revealing the scratches.
- The scratches can indicate how the film was preserved or restored over time.
- The production team had to create readouts by hand due to the lack of CGI technology in the 1960s.
- Techniques used to create computer readouts involved elaborate analog methods.
- Multiple copies of readout loops were likely used, leading to inconsistencies in visibility.
- The readouts were inspired by scientific materials, like graphs from _Scientific American_.
- The scratches provide a tangible connection to the film's physical medium.
- Each edition of the film has a unique presentation of these scratches.
- The film's restoration efforts have sparked discussions on authenticity and preservation.
- The "COM" display serves various functions, including video transmissions and data displays.
- Kubrick's design choices reflect a futuristic vision that was challenging to realize with the technology of the time.
- The layering of film elements contributes to the visibility of scratches in specific scenes.
- The production team faced numerous challenges with the mechanical setup for projecting readouts.
- The "unrestored" 70 mm print allows for a more authentic viewing experience, showcasing original film elements.
- The complexity of film restoration highlights the ongoing relationship between original and reproduced media.

## QUOTES:
- "There is a set of scratches in _2001: A Space Odyssey_ that are not _on_ the film, but _in_ the film."
- "They only occur when the 'COM' computer display is positioned on the far right side of the 2.20:1 frame."
- "The specific snapshots featured above were taken from Warner’s 2007 Blu-ray edition of _2001: A Space Odyssey_."
- "The scratches should be visible on all available copies, with two notable exceptions."
- "It was clear the scratches were not on the 70 mm print showing that afternoon, but in the film itself."
- "The fact that the scratches always appear within the confines of one of the computer displays indicates they occurred on one of the many 16 mm loops."
- "This can indicate the scratches occurred on the emulsion side of the 16 mm film."
- "The projected ubiquity of computer motion graphics decades in the future had been internalized by Kubrick."
- "We had to make something that looked like computer graphics by using conventional film and animation techniques."
- "The job of producing all of the readouts for '2001' took nearly a year."
- "We devised a fake language – HAL’s language of numbers and letters."
- "A scratch the width of a human hair will project on a 6 foot screen almost 3/4 inch wide."
- "Each motor operated in synchrony with the others, thereby enabling precisely controlled incremental changes."
- "Stanley wanted to shoot dialogue in the set, of course, and the projectors made quite a lot of noise."
- "The 'COM' display is part of a three-letter screen identification protocol along with other similar system displays."

## FACTS:
- The scratches are visible in editions from 1985 to 2018.
- They were filmed during production in 1965 or 1966.
- The scratches appear when the "COM" logo is displayed on the computer screens.

- The film was shot on Eastman Color Negative film 5251 50T stock.
- The production team used analog techniques to simulate computer graphics.
- The readouts were created without CGI due to technological limitations at the time.
- The projectors used for the readouts were Bell & Howell 16mm models.
- The film's restoration has raised questions about authenticity and preservation practices.
- The "COM" display also serves as a video feed for communication.
- The film was released in various formats including VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray.
- The scratches are absent in cropped versions made for television viewing.
- The color of the scratches suggests they occurred on the emulsion side of the film.
