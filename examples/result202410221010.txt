In this blog post, the author shares an exciting journey of upgrading the UPL’s people counting system, transforming it from outdated methods to a smart, automated solution using modern technology.

- The UPL has been using cameras since the 1990s to monitor room occupancy.
- A simple camera setup back then involved a $15 camera and a VCR, showing how far technology has come.
- The latest system aimed to answer the crucial question: "Is the UPL open right now?"
- To tackle this, a team created an automated people counting system using a webcam and AI.
- The original system reported the number of people present based on images taken every 15 minutes.
- This worked well until it became clear that people could be in the lab for meetings, leading to confusion about whether the lab was actually open.
- The author discovered a more reliable method using a door sensor, inspired by a similar setup at MIT.
- They chose to use Zigbee technology, which allows various smart devices to communicate without WiFi interference.
- With Zigbee, they set up door sensors that could indicate whether the doors were open or closed.
- The system was integrated with Home Assistant, making it easy to manage and monitor.
- A creative workaround was needed to ensure the door status updates were secure and reliable.
- By creating a web server that queries the Home Assistant API, they could display the door status on the UPL’s website and Discord channel.
- Now, the UPL community can easily check if the lab is open without unnecessary trips.

This project not only modernized the UPL’s monitoring system but also gave the author a sense of pride in creating something useful for their peers, showcasing the power of technology in everyday life!

## SUMMARY
A blog post by Amos Es describes the development of an automated occupancy detection system for the Undergraduate Projects Lab at the University of Wisconsin.

## IDEAS:
- The UPL has a long history of camera usage, dating back to the 1990s.
- Early systems relied on complex setups with outdated technology like VCRs and old video cameras.
- The latest camera systems have drastically reduced costs and improved quality.
- An automated occupancy detection system was developed to solve the problem of checking if the lab is open.
- The initial system used YOLOv7 for people detection via a Logitech C920 camera.
- The method of counting people presented issues, such as misidentifying objects as people.
- A more reliable door sensing method was inspired by MITERS’ setup at MIT.
- Zigbee technology was utilized for a wireless door status detection system.
- Home Assistant was implemented to manage the door sensors and provide real-time updates.
- The project demonstrated the importance of creating user-friendly solutions for common problems.
- The integration of various technologies (Raspberry Pi, Zigbee, Home Assistant) showcased the versatility of modern tools.
- The blog emphasizes the challenge of network connectivity and the need for autonomous systems.
- Development of a secure API was necessary to prevent unauthorized access to the system.
- Real-time monitoring of the door status provides immediate feedback to users.
- The project reflects a collaborative effort among UPL members to enhance their workspace.
- The use of Discord for status updates illustrates the blend of social platforms and technical solutions.
- There is satisfaction derived from creating a solution that enhances daily life.
- The project highlights the potential for DIY tech solutions in academic environments.
- Challenges encountered during development emphasized the importance of security in IoT systems.
- The blog promotes the idea of continuous improvement and iteration in tech projects.

## QUOTES:
- "What used to be several thousand dollars of equipment is now achievable with a $50 webcam plugged into a Raspberry Pi."
- "If you live anywhere off campus, it’s heartbreaking to see your arduous trek to the CS building result in failure."
- "This worked perfectly for a while — people would check the Discord channel name and see the estimated count of the number of people in the room."
- "There could be a meeting, or a separate gathering where the doors were closed and people weren’t allowed inside."
- "It was around this time that I stumbled upon the homepage of MITERS, a makerspace at MIT."
- "I decided against this approach for a few reasons..."
- "Zigbee is a low-rate mesh wireless protocol that allows for smart devices to communicate over a personal area network."
- "I decided to use these Aqara door and window sensors for this project."
- "Once this was all configured, I had the live statuses of the doors through the Home Assistant dashboard!"
- "I eventually learned that Home Assistant provides a RESTful API directly alongside the web dashboard."
- "Now, the server will query Home Assistant’s API on your behalf."
- "It’s so satisfying to watch this happen in real-time."
- "I find it pretty special that every time I check if the UPL’s open or not, I’m doing it via something that I made myself."
- "I made a quick webserver using Express that proxies the request with the bearer token."
- "The UPL website uses a header component which fetches the door status every 15 seconds."
- "Before you try, these endpoints aren’t in use anymore."

## FACTS:
- The Undergraduate Projects Lab has been in operation since the 1990s.
- Older camera systems included a $15 video camera connected to a VCR.
- The first iteration of the people counting system used a Logitech C920 camera.
- YOLOv7 is a model used for detecting people in images.
- MITERS is a makerspace at MIT that utilizes door sensing technology.
- Zigbee operates independently from WiFi or Bluetooth antennas.
- Aqara door sensors have a battery life of two years with replaceable batteries.
- Home Assistant is an open-source platform for managing network-connected devices.
- The UPL has both front and back entrances, necessitating door status monitoring.
- UWNet, the university's WiFi, provides access point isolation for security.
- Home Assistant's RESTful API allows for programmatic access to device states.
- The blog mentions security concerns regarding unauthorized access to the API.
- A Raspberry Pi can be repurposed for various monitoring tasks.
- The blog reflects a practical application of IoT in a university setting.
- Discord was used as a communication tool for status updates.
- The project involved collaboration among multiple UPL members.
