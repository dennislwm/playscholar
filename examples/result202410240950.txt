In this blog post, the author shares their transformation from a merger advocate to a rebaser, driven by the exciting concept of Fearless Rebasing.

- The author starts by admitting they used to prefer merging over rebasing in Git.
- They believed merging kept more history and had fewer conflicts compared to rebasing.
- Despite this, they found rebasing's linear history and cleanliness appealing.
- However, rebasing often led to frustrating conflicts that halted progress.
- Their perspective changed after discovering the Jujutsu project from Google.
- Jujutsu introduced a unique way to handle merge conflicts, allowing users to continue working without getting stuck.
- It creates special commits that note conflicts but keeps moving forward with other changes.
- Inspired by this, GitButler implemented a similar approach for their users.
- The new system allows users to partially apply changes even when conflicts arise.
- Users can resolve these conflicts in any order and continue making new commits.
- This change makes the rebasing process much more manageable and less stressful.
- The author invites others to try Fearless Rebasing with GitButler to experience its benefits.

In conclusion, the evolution of rebasing into a more user-friendly process could change how developers handle conflicts, making it an exciting tool for all.
