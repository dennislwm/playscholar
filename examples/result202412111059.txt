In this insightful blog post, Scott Aaronson shares his thoughts on Google’s recent announcement of their groundbreaking quantum chip, Willow, and its implications for the future of quantum computing.

- Scott just arrived at the Q2B conference, where he's speaking about quantum algorithms.
- Google unveiled their new 105-qubit chip called Willow, marking a significant advance.
- At the announcement, experts highlighted how the chip demonstrated better error correction and performance.
- Google has made impressive progress since their 2019 quantum supremacy claim, doubling qubit numbers and improving coherence time.
- The latest results show that as Google increases the size of their surface code, logical qubits last longer—a big win for quantum fault-tolerance.
- However, true fault-tolerance still requires more advancements, especially with two-qubit gates.
- Google also introduced a new supremacy experiment that would take an astronomical time to simulate with classical computers.
- But there's a catch: verifying the results of this experiment would also take an impossibly long time.
- The new experiment reignites old debates about the implications of quantum computing on our understanding of reality.
- Scott notes that Google’s achievements position them strongly against competitors in the quantum field.
- Skeptics like Gil Kalai continue to raise doubts about Google’s claims, but Scott believes the latest results are significant.
- He appreciates Google’s transparency in presenting their findings, contrasting it with past controversies in quantum computing.
- Scott ends with a hopeful tone about the progress being made in quantum technology.

In conclusion, the announcement of Google’s Willow chip represents a notable milestone that could reshape the landscape of quantum computing, inviting both excitement and skepticism from the community.
